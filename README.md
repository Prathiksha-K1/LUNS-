# 🧠 LUNS – Live Urban Nervous System
### Track 1: Agentic AI with Live Data

> **LUNS is an always-on agentic AI system that helps cities sense risks early, predict failures, and act before crises occur.**

LUNS behaves like a **nervous system for urban governance**, using **live data streams** and **autonomous AI agents** that continuously reason and adapt.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Modern cities generate massive amounts of data, but still fail because systems:

- React only **after** incidents happen  
- Rely on **static dashboards**  
- Break when data changes rapidly  
- Depend on humans to manually interpret signals  

Traditional RAG-based AI pipelines quickly become outdated, leading to **stale knowledge and delayed decisions**.

---

## ✅ Proposed Solution

LUNS introduces a **city-scale agentic AI architecture** where:

- Each urban domain has its **own AI agent**
- Agents run **continuously** (never sleep)
- Knowledge updates in real time
- Risks are predicted before thresholds are crossed
- Actions and alerts are triggered automatically

This shifts cities from **reactive response** to **predictive governance**.

---

## 🧠 Agentic AI Design

Each domain agent continuously performs the following loop:

1. Monitor live signals  
2. Compare with historical memory  
3. Detect abnormal drift  
4. Compute risk score (Low / Moderate / High)  
5. Predict near-future impact  
6. Recommend actions  
7. Trigger alerts (Citizen + Authority)  

This is **agentic behavior**, not query-based AI.

## 🌍 Domains Covered

LUNS includes **15 independent AI agents**, each purpose-built:

1. Disaster Management  
2. Transportation  
3. Healthcare  
4. Energy  
5. Cybersecurity  
6. Climate & Environment  
7. Public Safety  
8. Water Management  
9. Logistics & Supply Chain  
10. Economy  
11. Food Security  
12. Waste Management  
13. Industry  
14. Housing  
15. Education  

Each agent has **custom signals, memory, predictions, and alerts**.
